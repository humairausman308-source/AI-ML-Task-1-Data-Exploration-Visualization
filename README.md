# AI-ML-Task-1-Data-Exploration-Visualization
This repository contains Task 1 of my AI/ML internship, focused on dataset exploration and visualization. It includes data loading, cleaning, plotting, and analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
# Task 1 – Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

## Task Objective
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand data trends and distributions.

## Dataset Used
**Iris Dataset**
- Format: CSV
- Can be loaded using Seaborn or downloaded as a CSV file

## Steps Performed
### 1️⃣ Load the Dataset
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas

### 2️⃣ Initial Dataset Inspection
- Printed dataset shape
- Viewed column names
- Displayed first few rows using .head()
- Used .info() for dataset structure
- Used .describe() for summary statistics

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization
- Scatter Plot → to show relationships between features
- Histograms → to show value distributions
- Box Plots → to identify outliers
- Libraries used: Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Models Applied
No ML model was applied in this task.  
This task focuses only on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization**.

## Key Results & Findings
(You can edit and write based on your output, for example:)
- Iris dataset is clean and well-structured
- Features show clear separations between species
- Histograms show different distribution patterns for each feature
- Box plots identify slight outliers in some features
